## 🚀 How I Work

I follow a simple and effective approach:

1. **Understand the user & problem** – who is reading, what they’re trying to do  
2. **Break down the process** – into small, logical, ordered steps  
3. **Write clearly** – using simple, direct language and good structure  
4. **Format for readability** – headings, lists, highlights, screenshots where needed  
5. **Review & refine** – test steps myself and adjust for clarity  

> I believe good documentation should make users feel:  
> **“This is easy. I know exactly what to do next.”**
